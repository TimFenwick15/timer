    <p>The following links show different versions of a timer that test different responsive design methods on desktop and mobile.</p>
    <p><a href='static/timer.html'>Static version with Viewport only</a> This (or similar) is probably the best method.</p>
    <p><a href='vw/timer.html'>View width version</a> This version uses VW units so it sizes to mobile screens well but will appear too large on a larger screen. Setting a maximum size isn't trivial.</p>
    <p><a href='mediaQueries/timer.html'>Media Queries version</a> This uses CSS Media Queries to set a maximum size in px. This isn't a great method because phone screens tend to be high resolution so the size on large screens will still need to be too large.</p>
